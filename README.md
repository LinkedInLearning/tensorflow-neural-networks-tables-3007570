TensorFlow 2.0 is quickly becoming one of the most popular deep learning frameworks and a must-have skill in your artificial intelligence toolkit. Using a hands-on approach, instructor Jonathan Fernandes covers foundational skills for deep learning using TensorFlow 2.0, from creating single and multi-layer networks, to training a network, and using it to make predictions. He also covers loss functions, optimizers, and some of the data APIs unique to TensorFlow.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
